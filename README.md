# stats_scraper
Stat scraper which scrapes data from basketball-reference.com 
hopefully will soon be expanded to other sports branching from 
sports-reference.com 

Files Included:
 - player.py: player class to fetch attributes and basic season stats 
              on individual players
					  			  
 - attributes_scatter.py: uses seaborn and matplotlib to create scatter 
                          on player height v weight w/ points colored 
                          based on position
					  
 - charts directory: contains charts of shooting pct at diff. dists. 
                     and player height vs weight and position

 - example_csvs: directory has some example csvs created using the 
                 player class
                 
                 - Note for files in all_shots_in_career: shot data 
                   begins in the 2000-01 season so players which played 
                   before only have data from the 00-01 season and onward
