# stats_scraper
Stat scraper which scrapes data from basketball-reference.com 
hopefully will soon be expanded to other sports branching from 
sports-reference.com 

Files Included:
learn2.py:            functions used to scrape from basketball-reference.com
			          Note: last tested 04/07/2018 but if website HTML tags were
			          to change files would need updates.
			  
nba.csv:              created using functions in learn2.py to create csv of basic
		              career stats (ppg, rbpg, efg%, etc. ) of every active NBA
